# Daily-Water-Calculator
This application helps users calculate how much water they need to drink based on their weight and minutes of exercise. The calculator divides the user's weight in half and adds twelve ounces of water for every thirty minutes of exercise. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and made responsive by using the flexbox grid system.
